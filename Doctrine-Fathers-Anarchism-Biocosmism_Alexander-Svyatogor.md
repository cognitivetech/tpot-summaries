# The Doctrine of the Fathers and Anarchism-Biocosmism (Summary)
by Alexander Svyatogor

1. Early 20th century anarchist thought in Russia evolved through two main periods: uncritical (unified anarchism) and critical.
2. The unified anarchism phase was characterized by strict adherence to traditional doctrines, inability to adapt to reality, and ultimately failed during the Russian Revolution.
3. A crisis in anarchist thought led to the emergence of new ideologies, including syndicalism and universalism, which attempted to address the shortcomings of traditional anarchism.
4. Biocosmism arose as a new concept to replace outdated anarchist doctrines, offering a more decisive and courageous approach.
5. Biocosmism affirms the living human individual, emphasizing the instinct for immortality and the right to eternal existence in the cosmos.
6. The Biocosmist vision includes a new society united by the shared supreme goal of achieving interplanetarism, individual immortality, and resurrection of the dead.
7. Biocosmism rejects small community structures in favor of a global, interplanetary society based on work collectives rather than brotherhood.
8. The ideology views the Soviet state as having natural tendencies toward Biocosmism and emphasizes the need for a positive relationship with the revolutionary struggle.

### Early 20th Century Anarchist Thought and Its Evolution Towards Biocosmism

**Anarchism in the Russian Revolution: An Ideology's Development**

**Background:**
- Interested in anarchist thought during the Revolution, focusing on its development and main ideas
- Two periods: uncritical (unified anarchism) and critical
- Unequivocally subordinate to the "doctrine of the fathers" in the first period
- Critique of this period's characteristics and connection with the second cycle in Moscow and Ukraine.

**First Period: Unified Anarchism (Moscow Cycle)**
1. Revealed all characteristics of anarchist thought, including weaknesses and subordination to doctrine
2. No room for independent criticism or adaptation to reality
3. Rhetoric and propaganda with corresponding actions against Soviet regime
4. Spread to Ukraine as part of petty bourgeois movement, becoming active instead of purely rhetorical
5. Utopian project to immediately establish "kingdom of freedom"
6. Weakness: slavish subordination to doctrine and inability to analyze complex reasons behind events
7. Founding fathers' beliefs in human solidarity or justice led to unrealistic expectations
8. Failure to adapt thinking and actions to the revolutionary situation.

**Critical Period:**
- Emergence of a critical element voicing concerns but unable to free itself from infallibility of past commandments
- Weakness persisted, leading to overdependence on tradition and doctrines
9. Differentiation between Moscow and Ukrainian cycles: same essential ideas, intrinsically connected
10. Critique of first period's characteristics continued.

### The Crisis of Anarchist Thought and the Emergence of New Ideologies

**Anarchism in Russia and Ukraine:**

**Background:**
- Impossible to reconcile with unified anarchism during revolutionary situations
- Spread to Ukraine, where it reached absurd lengths and eventually exhausted itself
- Affiliation of anarchists with thugs or white guard elements made it controversial
- Reactionary views on communal economy held by Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Reclus
- Anarchism construed as "powerless power" after experiencing its own regime
- Failure of unified anarchism in Moscow prompted criticism period

**Characteristics of Anarchist Thought:**
- Adherence to doctrine in the first period
- Subordination to authority and inert fanaticism
- Criticism emerged due to external circumstances
- Two groups: tactical revision or complete overhaul
- Failures of both groups

**Syndicalists:**
- Attempted positive course of action for new society
- Followed Bakunin and Kropotkin's precepts
- Contradiction between building a new society and rejecting dictatorship
- Resulted in doomed enterprise due to ignorance of the need for a new ideology

**Universalists:**
- Acknowledged different approach to Soviet state
- Clarified need for "method" within socialist society
- Revealed weaknesses: same starting point as syndicalists, doctrine of fathers prevailed.

**Biocosmists:**
- Affirmations met with hostility from the old way of thinking
- Only new ideology can provide precise answers to questions raised by experience.

### The Dissolution of Traditional Anarchism and the Rise of Biocosmism

**Critique of Anarchism by Neo-Nihilist and Darani**

**Neo-nihilist Critique:**
- Believed anarchism was "closing its eyes to practical existence"
- Saw syndicalism as on a "downward spiral" and utopian
- Convinced that individualism is not balanced or unified
- Anarchism under Makhno's leadership lacked creative potential
- Acknowledged the need for new ideology based on original anarchist thought (individuality)

**Darani's Critique:**
- Old form of anarchism had "universal flaws"
- Theories concerning class nature and position in history were undeveloped
- Lack of agreement on social order and economic implementation
- Present moment revealed the need for revisiting all aspects of anarchism (theory, practice, organization)
- Believed new philosophical foundations were necessary to underpin anarchism
- Criticized old form's adherence to 18th century rationalism and advocated intuitive philosophy

**Quarrel Between Anarchist Thought and Revolution:**
- Utopianism lost due to tactical reasons
- Old concepts were disillusioned with new spirit, requiring a new form of anarchism
- Weakness of old anarchist thought prevented independent creativity and resolution of crisis

**Biocosmism as a New Concept:**
- Biocosmism is decisive, courageous, and sound way to replace outdated doctrine
- Grounds for hope that new anarchist forces will turn to Biocosmism.

### The Biocosmist Manifesto: Redefining Individuality and Immortality

**The Flaws of Old Anarchist Doctrines**
* Abstract concepts limit individual definition, rendering them unsound
* Negative view of the individual: belittling man and leaving him to his destiny
* Denied genuine creativity and immortality
* Lack of resolution for the problem of the individual
* Based on a narrow view of life within a static cycle
* Failure to account for an individual's dynamic sense or creative forces
* Considered outside unquenchable thirst for immortality and genuine creativity
* Denied real individuality, offering abstractions instead

**Biocosmism: Affirming the Living Human Individual**
* Belief in the living human individual
* Rejection of negative views on egoism or altruism
* Emphasis on instinct for immortality and thirst for eternal life
* Discovery and affirmation of a real living being, not an abstraction
* Man is not insignificant but strives towards creativity and immortality
* Supreme good: immortal life in the cosmos; supreme evil: death
* Individual right to eternal existence in the cosmos
* Goal is to win, create personal immortality, not just restore what's lost
* Immeasurably great creativity towards conquering the cosmos.

**Biocosmism vs. Modern Society and Old Anarchist Ideas**
* Destroys old society's foundations based on death and localized space
* Guarantees individual development and self-fulfillment in a harmonious society
* Unity of all towards the great aim: immortality and life in the cosmos
* Collective effort required to overcome death and cosmic space.

### The Biocosmist Vision: A New Society and Revolutionary Transformation

**Biocosmism and New Society**

**The New Society**:
- People unite not due to coercion, but because of a shared supreme goal
- Achieving interplanetarism, individual immortality, and resurrection of the dead is universally accepted as it works towards the greatest common good
- Precludes individual betrayal on behalf of lesser goals
- No need to negotiate loyalty contractually since individual will and action are infinitely repeated in comradeship

**Individual and Community**:
- Biocosmist society hones natural strength by supporting the individual and sense of community
- The more resolutely individualist, the more socially active one becomes

**Biocosmist Society**:
- Not made up of small communities or groups, which do not feel the need to expand their boundaries
- Rejecting the old bias toward small units is necessary to overcome atavism and the legacy of the Dark Ages
- Encompasses the whole world and is interplanetary

**Work Collective vs. Brotherhood**:
- **Work collective**: The most creative form of relationship, opposite of brotherhood
- In work collective, nothing is arranged but everything is achieved and created
- **Brotherhood**: Uncreative and historically obsolete, relationships are predetermined

**Revolution and Biocosmism**:
- Biocosmism was spawned in the storm of revolution
- The Revolution's victory is integral to Biocosmist beliefs
- The Soviet state, as a necessary organization within the revolutionary struggle, has natural tendencies toward Biocosmism
- The current need for a positive relationship with the Soviet system is emphasized
- Objections to the Soviet state as oppressive are nonsensical, as it guarantees man's freedom from the yoke of external nature
